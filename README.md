# ShinyApp - Data Pipeline

Developer: Yichen Zhang

This Shiny App serves as the crucial part of data pipeline. It allows multiple users to enter data throuhg the Shiny App. The formatted data will be stored in the local Rsqlite database. 

## Implementation 
To run the app on your machine, Simply type the following code in your R console:

```{r}
#install and load shiny if you are the first-time shiny user
##install.packages("shiny")
##library(shiny)

runGitHub("ShinyApp", "thisisyichenzhang")
```

## R-portable version 
This shiny app also has a R-portable version, which does not require pre-installation of R on your machine. You can simply copy-paste the R-portable in your laptop, and run the App with a 'Click'. Please contact the author for the Rportable App.
